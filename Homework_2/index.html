            A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction
            since the 1880s, and of aerospace engineering and scientific
            proposals
            <b> since the late 1940s</b>. Plans include landing on Mars for
            exploration at a minimum, with some considering exploring its moons
            Phobos and Deimos. Longterm proposals have included sending settlers
            and starting terraforming of the planet.

        <h2>Exploration of Mars</h2>
        <p>
          The exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for
          decades. Conceptual work for missions that would involve human
          explorers has been ongoing since <b>the 1950s</b>, with planned
          missions typically being stated as taking place anywhere between 10
          and 30 years from the time they are drafted.The list of
          <b>crewed</b> Mars mission plans shows the various mission proposals
          that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space agencies
          in this field of space exploration. Plans have varied from scientific
          expeditions, in which a small group (between two and eight astronauts)
          would visit Mars for a period of a few weeks or year, to a continuous
          presence (e.g. through research stations, colonization or other
          continuous humanization).[citation needed] Virtual visits to Mars,
          using haptic technologies, have also been proposed.[ In the 2010s,
          numerous US, European, and Asian agencies were developing proposals
          for human missions to Mars.[citation needed] In fiction, Mars is a
          frequent target of exploration and settlement in books, graphic
          novels, and films.
